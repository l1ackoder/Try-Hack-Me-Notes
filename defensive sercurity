# Defensive Security Summary

Defensive security focuses on **preventing** and **detecting** intrusions to protect systems and networks, contrasting with offensive security, which exploits vulnerabilities. Blue teams handle defensive tasks.

## Key Defensive Security Tasks
- **User Awareness**: Train users to recognize and avoid cyber threats.
- **Asset Management**: Document and manage systems/devices for protection.
- **System Updates**: Patch systems to fix known vulnerabilities.
- **Preventative Devices**: Use firewalls (control network traffic) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) (block malicious traffic).
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Track network activity to detect unauthorized devices or actions.

## Main Topics
### Security Operations Center (SOC)
- **Role**: Monitors networks/systems for malicious activity.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - **Vulnerabilities**: Fix weaknesses with patches or mitigation.
  - **Policy Violations**: Detect breaches of security rules (e.g., unauthorized data uploads).
  - **Unauthorized Activity**: Identify and block stolen credential usage.
  - **Network Intrusions**: Detect and respond to breaches quickly.
- **Threat Intelligence**:
  - Collects data (logs, forums) to understand adversariesâ€™ tactics, techniques, and motives.
  - Analyzes data to predict and mitigate attacks, creating actionable response strategies.

### Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
- **Digital Forensics**:
  - Investigates cybercrimes using:
    - **File System**: Analyze storage for evidence of programs/files.
    - **System Memory**: Examine memory for malicious programs.
    - **Logs**: Review system/network logs for attack traces.
- **Incident Response**:
  - Handles data breaches or attacks with four phases:
    - **Preparation**: Train teams and implement preventative measures.
    - **Detection & Analysis**: Identify and assess incidents.
    - **Containment, Eradication, Recovery**: Stop, remove, and recover from incidents.
    - **Post-Incident**: Document lessons to prevent recurrence.
- **Malware Analysis**:
  - Studies malicious software (viruses, trojans, ransomware).
  - **Static Analysis**: Inspect code without running it (requires assembly knowledge).
  - **Dynamic Analysis**: Run malware in a controlled environment to observe behavior.
