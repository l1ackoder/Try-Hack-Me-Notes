## 🌐 **Smart Internet Research for Cybersecurity**

### 🎯 **Lesson Goal**

Learn to:

* ✅ Evaluate online information sources
* 🔍 Use search engines efficiently
* 💡 Explore specialized search engines
* 📚 Read official technical documentation
* 💬 Use social media wisely
* 📰 Stay updated via trusted news outlets

---

## 🧠 **1. Evaluating Information Sources**

Not everything online is reliable — **anyone can publish anything**.
Before trusting info, check:

* **Source:** Who published it? Are they reputable (e.g., Cisco, NIST, OWASP)?
* **Evidence:** Are claims supported by facts, data, or research?
* **Objectivity:** Is it unbiased, or trying to sell/promote something?
* **Consistency:** Do multiple trusted sources say the same thing?

👉 *Example:* Don’t trust a random blog post about hacking tools — verify it against official cybersecurity forums or documentation.

## 🔍 **2. Search Engines & Smart Search Techniques**

Common search engines:

* Google — [google.com](https://www.google.com)
* Bing — [bing.com](https://www.bing.com)
* DuckDuckGo — [duckduckgo.com](https://duckduckgo.com)

### 🔧 **Useful Google Search Operators**

| Operator    | What It Does                   | Example                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `" "`       | Search for exact phrase        | `"passive reconnaissance"`           |
| `site:`     | Search within a domain         | `site:tryhackme.com success stories` |
| `-`         | Exclude words                  | `pyramids -tourism`                  |
| `filetype:` | Search for specific file types | `filetype:ppt cyber security`        |

💡 *Tip:* Combine operators for precise results, e.g.
`site:edu "cyber security" filetype:pdf`

## 🧭 **3. Specialized Search Engines for Cybersecurity**

### 🔎 **Shodan** – [shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io)

* Searches for Internet-connected devices (e.g., webcams, routers, IoT).
* Useful for seeing exposed systems or outdated software versions.
  🧩 *Example:* Search for `apache 2.4.1` to find servers running that version.

### 🌐 **Censys** – [censys.io](https://www.censys.io)

* Focuses on hosts, websites, and certificates.
* Helps find open ports, domains, or rogue assets.

### 🧪 **VirusTotal** – [virustotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com)

* Scans files or URLs with multiple antivirus engines.
* Can check by file upload or hash.
  💬 *Tip:* Read community comments for analysis insights.

### 🔐 **Have I Been Pwned (HIBP)** – [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com)

* Checks if your email appeared in a **data breach**.
* Reveals leaked credentials → change passwords immediately!

### 🧾 **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**

* A “dictionary” of known software/hardware vulnerabilities.
* Example ID: **CVE-2024-29988**
* Check via:

  * [CVE Program](https://www.cve.org)
  * [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov)

### 💣 **Exploit Database** – [exploit-db.com](https://www.exploit-db.com)

* Contains verified exploit codes for known vulnerabilities.
  ⚠️ *Only use with permission* (e.g., for authorized penetration testing).

### 🧰 **GitHub** – [github.com](https://github.com)

* Hosts proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit codes and security tools.
* Example search: `CVE-2014-0160` (Heartbleed exploit).

## 📖 **4. Reading Official Documentation**

### 🐧 **Linux Manual Pages**

* Access using the command: `man [command]`
  👉 Example: `man ip`
* Web version: search **“man ip”** on Google.
* Great for learning command syntax and options.

### 🪟 **Microsoft Technical Docs**

* [Microsoft Learn Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/)
  👉 Example: Search for **ipconfig**.

### 💼 **Product Documentation Examples**

* [Snort Docs](https://snort.org/documents)
* [Apache HTTP Server Docs](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/)
* [PHP Docs](https://www.php.net/docs.php)
* [Node.js Docs](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)

💡 *Tip:* Official docs = most accurate and up-to-date info.
